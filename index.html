        <p class="hidden">The Airline Management System allows users to book flight tickets online.
            <br> 
            Users first need to register by providing personal details, and subsequently 
            <br>
            login to book tickets. Users are required to select the type of airlines and 
            <br>
            specify their destination, based on which the system provides information 
            <br>
            on available flights and venues. After booking a ticket, users can view their 
            <br>
            reservation details and receive flight status notifications. The online flight
            <br> 
            reservation system also includes an admin dashboard to manage flight 
            <br>
            schedules, bookings, and cancellations. Admins can view reservations made 
            <br>
            by passengers and add notices related to flights, such as changes in flight
            <br> 
            timings or cancellations. The system provides a secure payment gateway for 
            <br>
            online transactions, as well as multilingual support to facilitate interaction in 
            <br>
            the user's preferred language. It also generates reports and analytics on flight 
            <br>
            bookings, revenue, and other performance indicators to help airlines 
            <br>
            optimize their operations. The Airline Management System aims to provide 
            <br>
            a user-friendly and efficient platform for both customers and airlines, 
            <br>
            enabling a seamless booking experience and optimized operations.
